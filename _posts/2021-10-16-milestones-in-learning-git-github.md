I have learned git/github since 2019. They have been great tools for me ever since I started my path. The article intend to show stages of my git/github discoveries. Note that it is not meant to be a complete course of learning these tools.

### Stage 1. git 101

Three _Hello World!_ commands in git are probably `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`. They appear in nearly every git tutorial. After that, you may find `git log`, `git reset`, `git rebase` useful while working with commits.

### Stage 2. Go online

There is a saying (which needs to be filled by yourself)

> git and github are similar like ... and ... are similar.

Github provides a platform for developers to extend git's utilities online. First thing first, you may learn how to create a simple repository on github and then connect it with your local repository by `git push`, `git pull` commands. You and your colleagues may create an organization and teams to work with each other smoothly.

### Stage 3. Teamwork on Github

Now you are in an organization, and you collaborate on a repository with your teammates. Then you should take advantage of issues and pull requests to improve your work. Especially, make sure that you have [your notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications) turned on and learn to mention _anyone/anything_ in conversation. The mentioning includes issues, pull requests, commits, even team members.

### Stage 4. Github CLI

See [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for instructions on how to completely manage github workflows on a terminal.

### Stage 5+

Currently, there's no thing left in my mind. The stages above are literally all git/github essentials I have known since 2019. Perhaps I can append more content as the time goes on.
