Integer programming (IP) is a powerful tool of solving problems, especially when tackling with combinatorics ones. As far as I know, all problems with finite search spaces can be translated into IP models. Even in the worst case, we can cut off each candidate once at a time until we find a feasible solution or prove the infeasibility of the problem. Besides the various uses in different scenario, IP models can be efficiently solved by [the fastest solver](https://www.gurobi.com/).

This page mainly contains my articles related to **Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)**, a specific branch of IP. Hope that my adventure in integer programming would inspire you.
