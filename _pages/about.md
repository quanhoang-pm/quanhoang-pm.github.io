Hi everyone,

I'm Hoàng Anh Quân (Quan Hoang for short), a graduate at the [VNU University of Science](http://hus.vnu.edu.vn/) in Vietnam. I'm currently a teaching assistant/instructor in the Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics at the VNU University of Science. Yep, that's where I graduated from.

My main interest is Mathematics because of its beauty and rigorous. I also enjoy other things, but that is the story for another time.

Below is a picture of me passionately presetting a mathematical topic. It was taken in 2021, by a very special person to me. Thank _you_ for everything!

There are ideas that have inspired me, most of them are in mathematics. I'm willing to introduce them to you. Perhaps they will motivate you to get to know about the topics, or at least realize that they exist.

The page is created to force me to write regularly, hence improving my writing ability. It is like a personal commitment to myself. As Leslie B. Lamport rightly said,
> If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking.

Hope you have some inspirations while being here.
