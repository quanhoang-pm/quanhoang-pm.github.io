Hi everyone,

I'm Quan Hoang. I was an undergraduate student at Vietnam National University in Vietnam. I'm interested in Mathematics because of its beauty and rigorous. I also enjoy other things, but that is the story for another time.

There are ideas that have inspired me, most of them are in mathematics. I'm willing to introduce them to you. Perhaps they will motivate you to get to know about the topics, or at least realize that they exist.

The page is created to force me to write regularly, hence improving my writing ability. It is like a personal commitment to myself. As Leslie B. Lamport rightly said,
> If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking.

Hope you have some inspirations while being here.
