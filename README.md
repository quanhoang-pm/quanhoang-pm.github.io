### Hello World! :smiley:

My site is forked from [Minimal Mistakes site][link:mm-site]. I also apply some custom configurations in [Shailendra Paliwal's site][link:shailendra-site].

Reference:
- [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme][link:mm-theme]

[link:mm-site]: https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter
[link:shailendra-site]: https://github.com/vcidst/vcidst.github.io
[link:mm-theme]: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes


#### Preview the blog locally

```sh
bundle clean # optional
bundle install # run once
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 1234
```

The local link would be http://127.0.0.1:1234.
